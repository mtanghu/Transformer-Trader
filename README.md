Personal forex modeling repo

Current ideas:
- need a solid experiment on how the transaction cost affect performance
- reintroduce volume, can give supply/demand info, and shouldn't all day trading
- if the model is underfitting, would a multilabel CE loss work?
- debugging, should really have assert statements to ensure code is working correctly
- higher learning rates? With the current gating, I have to imagine very little gradient is passing
- interleaving with possibly a restarts learning rate schedule
- I am interested in trying a LEAP approach


Improving my process:
- what are the issues?
