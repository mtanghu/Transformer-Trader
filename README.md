Tough but interesting goal:
- Add denoising objectives the just minimize the L2 loss of reconstructing the embeddings as an auxillary loss to boost scaling
  - Based on [UL2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131.pdf) and [Transcending Scaling Laws with 0.1% Extra Compute](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11399.pdf)
